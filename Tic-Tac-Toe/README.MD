# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python and the tkinter library for the graphical user interface.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- tkinter library

## How to Run

1. Ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your system. You can check this by running `python --version` or `python3 --version` in your terminal or command prompt.

2. Install the tkinter library if it's not already installed. It usually comes pre-installed with Python. If not, you can install it using the following command:

   ```
   pip install tk
   ```

   or

   ```
   pip3 install tk
   ```

3. Save the provided code in a file named `tic_tac_toe.py`.

4. Run the script using the following command:

   ```
   python tic_tac_toe.py
   ```

   or

   ```
   python3 tic_tac_toe.py
   ```

5. The Tic-Tac-Toe game window will appear, and you can start playing the game.

## How to Play

- The game board consists of a 3x3 grid.
- Player 'X' starts the game.
- Players take turns clicking on an empty cell to place their symbol ('X' 'O').
- The first player to get 3 of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
- If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
- A message box will appear at the end of the game, announcing the winner declaring a draw.
- To play again, close the game window and run the script again.

Enjoy playing Tic-Tac-Toe!
